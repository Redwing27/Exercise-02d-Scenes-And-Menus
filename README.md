Exercise for Redwing27

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game. Recently added the ability to shoot at asteroids. Created in Unity.

## Implementation
For extra points, I added background music, a background image, a custom UFO enemy asset, and varied traveling behavior for the enemy.

UFO asset created using Krita (https://krita.org/en/)
